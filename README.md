# Title: Raising Awareness on Tuberculosis Through a Simple Website

## Introduction

 I put together a simple yet impactful website dedicated to raising awareness about tuberculosis. This project was designed to provide accessible and clear information about TB, its symptoms, prevention strategies, and available treatments. The internet is filled with a vast array of content, but this project adds one more website dedicated to a meaningful cause.

## Benefits of the Website

    • Improved Public Health Knowledge: Encouraging people to recognize symptoms early can lead to timely medical intervention.
    • Resources and Links: A section providing links to official TB-related organizations, donation links and further reading materials.
    • Mobile-Friendly Design: The website is responsive and works seamlessly across various devices.

## Source Code and Design

 For transparency and further development, the project’s source code and design files have been made available. Interested individuals can contribute to improving the website or use the resources for educational purposes.
